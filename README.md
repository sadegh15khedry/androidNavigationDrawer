# Android Navigation Drawer

This repository contains code for implementing a navigation drawer in an Android application. The navigation drawer provides access to various app destinations or functionalities through a side menu that users can open by swiping from the left edge of the screen or tapping the menu icon.

## Summary

The code in this repository demonstrates how to implement a navigation drawer in an Android app using the Navigation Drawer component provided by the Android Jetpack library. The navigation drawer typically consists of a menu list containing items representing different sections or features of the app. When users select an item from the navigation drawer menu, the corresponding destination or action is displayed in the main content area of the app.
